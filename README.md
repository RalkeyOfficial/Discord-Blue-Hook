Blue Hook is an open source project dedicated to being able to send webhook's to discord's webhook service with an easy to use GUI

## What is a webhook?

a webhook is a custom URL which acts as a gateway between any kind of service (script, website, etc) and discord channels.

by sending data to the custom URL we can get discord to display a message in a discord channel.

by using Blue Hook's easy to use GUI you are able to send highly customized messages to the channel.
